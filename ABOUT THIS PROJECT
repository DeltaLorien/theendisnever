Welcome to The End Is Never The End. This is a project about my experience making art and the time and energy it takes. I find that there's a certain horror to the amount of time and work you can put into something only to have it not quite work. I decided I'd make a project about it in the hopes that I could bring that sort of feeling to light for everybody else who doesn't create on such a regular basis.
I hope you enjoy this story.
